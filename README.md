krt-subsupercritical.mp4:
Showcases 3 rays, emitted from the same location but with initial momenta tuned
such that one ray falls into the black hole, one ray is bound, and the other is
ejected to infinity.

krt-Lyapunov-long-trails.mp4:
Showcases 3 pairs of rays. In each pair, one of the rays is emitted with
momentum such that it is bound, while the other is shot with the same momentum
but perturbed slightly in radius by an amount delta r. The separation between
the rays in each pair increases as the trajectories undergo an increasing
number of half-orbits, with the separation rate determined by the Lyapunov
exponent. I have also included a plot of the value of the Lyapunov exponent as
one moves radially through the photon sphere, along with the selected radii and
corresponding Lyapunov values color coded to match the movie.

krt-Lyapunov-short-trails.mp4:
Same as the previous description, except I've shortened the length of the ray
trails to make the movie a bit less busy.

krt-equatorial-rays-with-embedding-diagram.mp4:
A side-by-side movie. The left-hand side shows equatorially orbiting rays about
a high-spin black hole that eventually eject to infinity. The rays start in the
same position, but one of the rays has a larger initial momentum, leading to
more rapid escape. On the right-hand side is the embedding diagram of the
equatorial plane along with the mapped ray trajectories. We see the photons
orbit and then climb out of the throat.
